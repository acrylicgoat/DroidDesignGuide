Droid Design Guide
==================

This Android app wraps the Google Android Design Guide in a app setup with a tablet layout.  It was an exercise to learn [ActionbarScherlock](http://actionbarsherlock.com/).  The code is open source under an LGPL license.  See LICENSE.txt for details.  Be sure to add ActiobarSherlock as a library project. The app will run on an Android 2.3 phone, but the web site is not formatted for a small device.  It was tested on an ICS tablet.
