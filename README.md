Droid Design Guide
==================

This Android app wraps the Google Android Design Guide in a tablet layout. It was an exercise to learn ActionbarSherlock. The app will run on an Android 2.3 phone, but the web site is not formatted for a small device. It was tested mainly on ICS and Jellybean tablets.

The app has the following features as part of the ActionbarSherlock demo:
  * Icon on the actionbar
  * Overflow item
  * Spinner 
  * Up to home (in portrait)
  * Setting title and subtitle
